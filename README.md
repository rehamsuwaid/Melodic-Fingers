# Melodic-Fingers

#### Project Melodic Fingers is the development of software that will use image processing to translate a user’s hand gestures into sounds. This will allow the user to play a melody using their hands without physically touching the device. The goal of this program is to allow users to play a simulated instrument through a camera. 

## How to use

1. Download the zip file or clone the repository.

2. Make sure you have the following tools installed in your MatLab before trying to run the program.
    - Computer Vision Toolbox
    - Image Processing Toolbox
    - MATLAB Support Package for USB Webcams
    
3. As for the hardware requirments:
    - Microsoft® LifeCam Cinema(TM)
    - Stand for Camera
    - monochrome background(white or off-white color) 

> Side Note: Make sure to have the camera positioned on a fixed distance (18-20) cm far from  facing a monochrome surface with a contrasting difference between the hand and surface color(white, off-white) in order to get accurate results.

4. Run the `HandGApp.mlapp` to execute the program.
