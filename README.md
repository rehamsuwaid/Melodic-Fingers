# Melodic-Fingers

#### Project Melodic Fingers is the development of software that will use image processing to translate a userâ€™s hand gestures into sounds. This will allow the user to play a melody using their hands without physically touching the device. The goal of this program is to allow users to play a simulated instrument through a camera.
